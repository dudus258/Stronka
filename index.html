			Ancient Olympic Games
			</h2>
			<p>
				The ancient Olympic Games were organized every four years. They were held in honor of Zeus, and the Greeks gave them mythological origin.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first Olympics is dated to 776 BC. They continued to be celebrated when Greece came under Roman rule, until the emperor Theodosius I suppressed them in AD 393 as part of the campaign to impose Christianity as the State religion of Rome. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The games were always held at Olympia.
				During the celebration of the games, an Olympic Truce was enacted so that athletes could travel from their cities to the games in safety. The prizes for the victors were olive leaf wreaths or crowns.
